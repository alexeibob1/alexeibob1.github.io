      "longDescription": "Baklanov's mastery was formed under the influence of such prominent masters of architecture as I. Langbard, M. Parusnikov, and M. Barshch. Baklanov shared their creative passions and throughout 1944-1950 was their student and active assistant. Baklanov asserted his creative independence only in 1949 when he received his first major commission to design a building for the State Picture Gallery of the BSSR."
